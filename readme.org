* Downer - Simple terminal RSS torrent downloader
  Downer is a commandline RSS torrent downloader with a set of very
  focused functionality. Currently Downer saves no state between
  invocations so fireing a new process will have no knowledge of
  previously seen torrents. We leave that to the torrent program.

  Currently only handles torrent files over HTTP(S).

** Possible future features
- [ ] Awareness of episodes
- [ ] Persist state between invocations?
- [ ] Support for magnet links
